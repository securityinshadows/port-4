# port-4
A python (console-based) local password manager.

In this password manager you can save, generate, and search your browsing passwords.

The application is accessible via a master password input in the beginning.

Resetting the master password starts over again and removes all saved passwords.

All of the input data is encrypted before being stored.

NOTE: This project is more cybersecurity oriented.
